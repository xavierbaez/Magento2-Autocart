XAVIER BAEZ PHP Developer Magento Test
Objective
Create an extension for Magento 2 which will allow users to be directed to a URL on Magento and have a specific product added to their cart.
 
•	The inbound Magento link will be generated by a trusted website which you would theoretically have access to if required.
•	Assume that the url contains the product id which should be added to the users cart.
•	Once the product is added to the cart, the user should be redirected to their cart. 
•	Allow multiple products to be added in a scalable way from a single request.
